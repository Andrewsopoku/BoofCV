- Add signed/unsigned flag to ImageBase?

- Why is Laplacian second derivative?  Adjust its class name

- GUI application for showing different image derivatives
 * derivative X and Y
 * intensity

- Generic convolutions
* generic with precomputed image offsets
* Handle edge conditions
  - Renormalize the kernel for blur operations
  -
* benchmark for speed

- Edges
 * Whole image:
    - Intensity and orientation
 * Connected Segments
    - Canny?

- Thresholding
 * Global Threshold
 * Adaptively select global threshold
 * Local Threshold

- Specialized Convolutions
*   Gaussian

- Corners
 * Evaluate for accuracy
 * See corner section

- Convolve
 * Change TestConvolveImageStandard into a completely automated test using reflections

- Improve Sort Median Filter
*   Use bubble sort to avoid resorting each time

- InterpolateRectangle
 * Have output be an image
