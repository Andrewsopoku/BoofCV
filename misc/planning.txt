- BinaryPolygonConvexDetector
  * Reject a shape if after optimization contour points are really far away from it on average
  * Flag to return shapes which touch the image border
    - Only optimize sides/corners which don't touch the border
  * New binarization.  Run square binary twice with scale 0.9 and 1.1 .  Then output binary is the AND of the two
    - Should supress noisy regions?
  * Figure out a way to get it to work with smaller splits.  Like the cotour around the letter F
    - The initial polygon fit is the weak point

- Improve pose estimate for calibration fiducials

- Assisted Calibration
  * binary pattern grid
  * Ability to change calibration model and recompute
  * Ability to remove images and recompute

- HOG

Future

- Dense Features
  * See if pruning low contrast regions improve scoring
    - Prune X fraction per image or global threshold across all images
    - Print debugging info to help with tuning?
  * See if different image sampling methods can improve scene recognition

- Fiducial Square
  * Regression tests that can determine if orientation is consistent
    - If multiple squares on same surface see if their orientation is the same
  * Image fiducial.  Look at all the images and compute pixel weighting of pattern based on variance.
                     Put all patterns which meet the correctness fraction then use the weighted sum to
                     select the winner.

- Multi camera calibration using square binary patterns.

- Sparse Bundle Adjustment?

- Look at Sandreas's NewWarp?

- Background Model
  * GMM model
  * Shadow removal
  * remove support for MultiSpectral once Interleaved is supported enough

- Unit test for getScaleAtRadius
  * Implement universally
  * Create unit test for it
