- BinaryPolygonConvexDetector
  * See if it will work with concave shapes too

- SnapToEdge
  * Does it really need to know if left/right is darker/lighter?
  * Can't it just maximize the difference
  * Change RefineCornerLinesToImage and RefinePolygonLineToImage

- Fiducial Square
  * Have base class compute threshold, binarize, and have adjustable black rectangle width

- QuadPoseEstimator
  * For special case, optimize only translation and assume known rotation
  * Or some how estimate both at same time.  using center seems to introduce translation error

- Multi camera calibration using square binary patterns.

- Sparse Bundle Adjustment?

- Look at Sandreas's NewWarp?

- Background Model
  * Gaussian Mixture Model for individual pixels
  * Shadow removal
  * remove support for MultiSpectral once Interleaved is supported enough

- Dense SIFT
  * Fix SIFT

- Unit test for getScaleAtRadius
  * Implement universally
