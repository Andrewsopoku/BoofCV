Alpha 0.20

- BinaryPolygonConvexDetector
  * Can detect shapes with various number of edges in the same detector

- SnapToEdge
  * Does it really need to know if left/right is darker/lighter?
  * Can't it just maximize the difference
  * Change RefineCornerLinesToImage and RefinePolygonLineToImage

- Fiducial Square
  * Have base class compute threshold, binarize, and have adjustable black rectangle width

- QuadPoseEstimator
  * For special case, optimize only translation and assume known rotation

- Multi camera calibration using square binary patterns.

- Sparse Bundle Adjustment?

- Look at Sandreas's NewWarp?

- Background Model
  * Gaussian Mixture Model for individual pixels
  * Shadow removal
  * remove support for MultiSpectral once Interleaved is supported enough
